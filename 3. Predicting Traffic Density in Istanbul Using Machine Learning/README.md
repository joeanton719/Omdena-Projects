# THE BACKGROUND

Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, is infamous for its heavy traffic. The traffic density problem in Istanbul is a complex issue that stems from several factors such as population growth, urban sprawl, inadequate public transportation, and a high number of private vehicles on the roads. With over 15 million residents and growing, the city's roads are often gridlocked, particularly during peak hours.
According to a survey by Yeditepe University, about 55% of the time drivers and passengers spent during travel in 2017 was lost due to traffic intensity. The distance to be traveled in 20 minutes in open traffic was taken in about 45 minutes. At heavy traffic hours, the average driving speed was determined to be 36 km/h.

Some of the data from the study are as follows:

* Istanbulites are sacrificing an average of 3.5 years of their lives for the delays caused by the intensity in the city traffic.
* Drivers moving in the arterial roads of Istanbul in 2017 moved at an average speed of 37 km / h during the day, and 54% of their time was lost due to traffic congestion.
* In the same arterial roads, the average speed of the drivers was measured at 26 km / h during the weekday mornings. 67% of the time the drivers spent on the road traveling in the morning was caused by traffic intensity.
* These values ​​increased even more during weekday evenings. Drivers moved at an average speed of 22 km / h and lost 71% of their time due to traffic congestion.



# The Problem
The Turkish government has initiated several infrastructure projects and transportation improvements to alleviate the traffic density in Istanbul, however the issue still remains a huge problem for the residents.

Predictive AI can provide valuable insights into traffic patterns and enable authorities to take proactive measures to reduce traffic density in Istanbul. It could optimize traffic flow in real-time, provide personalized travel recommendations, and ultimately lead to a more efficient and sustainable transportation system for the city.



# Project Goals
In this project, the Omdena Turkey Chapter team aims to develop a model that will predict traffic density levels accurately, using data from various sources, including IBB Data Portal, weather forecasts, event schedules etc.

In this process, we also want to create an analysis to provide insight on factors affecting congestion, using data visualization tools.
With a duration of 6-weeks, this project aims to:


* Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis
* Preprocessing
* Feature Extraction
* Model Development and Training
* Evaluate Model
* Final Documentation


# Learning Outcomes
Time Series Forecasting, Data Extraction, API, Predictive Anaylsis, Data Visualization
